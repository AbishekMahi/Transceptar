                        <p> Developed based on organic elements, biosensors are small devices, implantable or not, that
                           use biological reactions to detect a certain target, facilitating the disease x
                           identification interface, without losing diagnostic quality (such as sensitivity and
                           specificity). They are basic structure equipment, composed of a recognition element, a
                           transducer and a processing unit, and their application will depend on the phenomenon or
                           property to be evaluated and the type of sample used. Capable of identifying substances in
                           real time, biosensors are highly sensitive, selective and simple (dispensing with the use of
                           more complex and costly technologies), in addition to providing several advantages, such as
                           ease and speed in diagnosis, portability, easy handling, accessibility and readiness for use,
                           that is, they do not require any type of installation or prior configuration. Clinical
                           analyzes and diagnoses are the main target of research and production of biosensors and, with
                           regard to health, the possibilities for their application are countless: monitoring of
                           chronic conditions, tracking of drugs and their actions, optimization of bioprocesses, dosage
                           of oxygen or alcohol levels in the blood, genetic analyzes and many others. Currently,
                           progress in the field of molecular biology, along with the creation of different types of
                           sensors for cell analysis, has been increasing the possibilities of using biosensors. This
                           has drawn the attention of researchers regarding the development and use of this equipment
                           for the detection of infectious diseases (Dengue, for example), genetic mutations and for the
                           diagnosis and prevention of cancer (a complex and multifactorial disease). Another event that
                           has attracted a lot of attention is the use of nanotechnology in the manufacture of these
                           devices.

                        <h2 class="pbmit-title">SITUATION</h2>
                        <p>The field of biosensors is expanding, mainly due to their versatility, their association with
                           low cost and their easy disposal (following environmental standards), which makes their
                           application increasingly viable. Data show that by 2022 the biosensors market could move
                           around US$ 27 billion, with the medical application representing 66% of this entire market.
                           Furthermore, its development is a simple idea that can provide a huge advance for science and
                           technology, being seen as a new alternative for analysis.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="pbmit-title">OBJECTIVE</h2>
                        <p>As the main objective of biosensors is to improve patient screening, streamline their care,
                           facilitate therapies and reduce medication risks, it is very important that, together with
                           the biotechnological progress contained in these devices, people's consumption and
                           understanding be worked on, to that the objective is achieved effectively. To this end, these
                           products have been made to make them smaller, simpler and clearer (helping to break some
                           prejudices); thus, its use will become intuitive and open to any type of person, regardless
                           of their level of knowledge, as is the case with the blood glucose meter, which is one of the
                           greatest examples of the application of a biosensor in health: a simple device that the some
                           governments itself offers free of charge to people with diabetes, where its ease of handling
                           is so great that there is no resistance regarding its use, application and measurement
                           safety.
                        </p>
                        <h3>PROBLEMS:</h3>
                        <p>Since the first commercial biosensor was developed using technology created by Leland C.
                           Clark, thousands of studies and surveys for various analytes have been published. However,
                           few of them are commercially available due to the technical challenges to make them portable
                           and applicable in our daily lives. Studies show that there are cells developing in the breast
                           tissue before the appearance of the tumor. Therefore, before the appearance of a nodule, it
                           would be possible to detect early breast cancer. Traditional methods use breast touch
                           examination and mammography. In the touch exam, the woman can only identify the cancer when
                           the nodule is already one centimeter or more. In mammography it is possible to detect nodules
                           of up to four millimeters. In these cases, the cancer is already installed and, many times,
                           it can be too late.
                        </p>
                        <h3>SOLUTIONS:</h3>

                        <p>Research for the development of low-cost, reusable, wearable and wireless biosensors. To
                           achieve this goal, multidisciplinary teams need to work in harmony to enable control of the
                           device's production process and overcome any technical issues. Our solution is the creation
                           of an electrochemical platform specially structured to accurately and highly sensitively
                           monitor interactions between proteins. For example, for Cancer prevention, our concept
                           intends the manufacture a biosensor the size of a 50 cent coin with 64 integrated sensors,
                           capable of identifying breast cancer early. The device will detect in a very simple way and
                           in a few minutes the presence of a protein that indicates the appearance of a breast tumor
                           still in its pre-development stage before the appearance of the nodule. The examination with
                           the device, will allow the detection of cancer through a single drop of blood. <br>
                           This biosensor will be able to identify the HER2 protein (Human Epidermal Growth Factor
                           Receptor 2), which, in abnormal amounts, appears in 25% to 30% of cases of breast cancer.
                           Another example is a device to be used in the detection of the interaction between ADAM17, a
                           metalloproteinase associated with the development and progression of different types of
                           tumors, with its ligand, thioredoxin. <br>
                           This electrochemical biosensor could pave the way for future rapid tests capable of
                           contributing to the diagnosis and even prognosis of cancer and other diseases. The idea is to
                           detect proteins associated with pathologies in samples of saliva and other body fluids (known
                           as liquid biopsies) and thus help doctors choose the most appropriate therapies for each
                           patient.
